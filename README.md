# üõí Mancino Market ‚Äî Synthetic Grocery Retail Dataset

This repository contains a comprehensive synthetic dataset that simulates the operations of a fictitious grocery retail chain in Manhattan, New York City. The **Mancino Market** dataset has been carefully designed to reflect the complexity of real-world retail environments while ensuring that all data is fully anonymized and safe for public use.

The dataset includes store information, product catalogs, customer profiles, inventory coverage, and detailed transaction histories across both in-store and online channels. It captures essential dynamics of modern grocery retailing such as store-level assortment differences, customer home store allocations, multi-channel sales, realistic basket sizes, and reconciled financials with tax calculations.

This project is an open-source sandbox for data professionals, educators, and students who want to explore retail analytics, practice database design, or build predictive and prescriptive models in a risk-free environment.
