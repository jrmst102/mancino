# 🛒 Mancino Market
## Synthetic Grocery Retail Dataset

This repository contains a comprehensive synthetic dataset that simulates the operations of a fictitious grocery retail chain in Manhattan, New York City. The **Mancino Market** dataset has been carefully designed to reflect the complexity of real-world retail environments while ensuring that all data is fully anonymized and safe for public use.

The dataset includes store information, product catalogs, customer profiles, inventory coverage, and detailed transaction histories across both in-store and online channels. It captures essential dynamics of modern grocery retailing such as store-level assortment differences, customer home store allocations, multi-channel sales, realistic basket sizes, and reconciled financials with tax calculations.

This project is an open-source sandbox for data professionals, educators, and students who want to explore retail analytics, practice database design, or build predictive and prescriptive models in a risk-free environment.

* **Data Mining & Machine Learning**: Train models for tasks like basket analysis, churn prediction, or demand forecasting.
* **Database Design & SQL Practice**: Model relational schemas and practice complex joins, constraints, and queries across interrelated entities.
* **Retail Simulation & Forecasting**: Simulate promotions, test pricing rules, or develop dynamic assortment strategies.
* **Teaching & Workshops**: Provide students with a realistic dataset for hands-on projects and case studies.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

This release (**v1_2025-08-24**) contains the following CSV files:

| File | Records | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `stores.csv` | **5** | Store master data (IDs, names, addresses, borough, geo coordinates, sqft). |
| `products.csv` | **2,000** | Product catalog across 15 grocery categories, with brand, size, tax codes, and price. |
| `product_store_inventory.csv` | **≈8,000** | Store-level inventory coverage (on-hand units, reorder points, price overrides). |
| `customers.csv` | **5,000** | Synthetic customers with realistic NYC addresses, ZIPs, and lat/long sampled inside neighborhood boundaries. |
| `transactions.csv` | **~33,000** | Transaction headers for **2025-07-01 → 2025-08-24**, across in-store and online channels. |
| `transaction_items.csv` | **~200,000+** | Line-level detail; basket sizes 3–12 items; reconciled totals per transaction. |
| `meta.json` | — | Metadata about dataset size, time window, and generation parameters. |

🔹 **Totals always reconcile**: transaction headers = sum of line items + tax.  
🔹 **Geo consistency**: store coordinates match listed addresses; customers sampled inside catchment neighborhoods.  
🔹 **Currency**: all prices in cents (integers).
